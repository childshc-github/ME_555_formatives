For this assignment, you will write a function (and code to test it) that
computes the square root of an integer and indicates whether the input is a
perfect square. Open sqrt.c and you will see the function

int square_root(int x, int * perfect);

If x is a perfect square, the function should update the box "perfect" points
to to be 1 and return the square root of x. 

If x is not a perfect square, the function should update the box "perfect"
points to to be 0 and return the largest integer less than the exact square
root of x. (Let us say the correct behavior if x is negative is for square_root
to return -1.) 

For example, if the argument for x is 4, this function would update the box
perfect points to to be 1 and return 2. If the argument for x is 5, this
function would update the box perfect points to to be 0 and return 2.

You are given several test cases in main, along with two test cases you should
write. We provide a helper function for testing that calls square_root and
prints the result. To help you with the pointer operations, we recommend
drawing a careful picture of test_one calling square_root.

We provide a Makefile you can use to compile your program and a file
expected_ans.txt that contains the expected output of sqrt.c once you have
added the two test cases.

You will submit sqrt.c for this assignment.
