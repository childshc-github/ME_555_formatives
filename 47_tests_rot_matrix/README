For this assignment, you will write test cases for your next assignment. As
usual, the instructions for the next assignment are in next-README.

For this assignment, we have created compiled binaries (in
/usr/local/intro_prog/rot_matrix/ where rotateMatrix is correct, and the
numbered ones are each broken in some way). 

As with the testing assignment for match5, you will write a file called
tests.txt, which will list the command line arguments you want to use to run the
programs. However, unlike the previous assignment, you will also want to create
a wide variety of input files. You can name them anything you want, as long as
you save them in the current (47_tests_rot_matrix) directory, and submit them
along with tests.txt. 

For example, if you would run the program as:

./rotateMatrix input.txt

then that line of tests.txt would say:

input.txt

As usual, we have provided run_all.sh.

Hint: think about various error cases that the programmer might have forgotten!
