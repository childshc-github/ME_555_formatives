Suppose that the int type is 32 bits, and you have:

int x = 5;
double d = 2.4;
char c = 'a';

Determine the type and value of each of the following expressions, and write
them in answers.txt. If the operation overflows, write "overflow" and if the
operation underflows, write "underflow". The first is done for you. 

1. x - 2
2. x + d
3. x / 2
4. d + x / 3
5. c + x
6. x + 0xFFFFFFFF
7. d + c
